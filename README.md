# data-structure-algorithms
A repository for a few algorithms made in Algorithms Design class in the university ITCM

Some practice in the class Algorithm Design in my university.
The code is a little ugly, my purpose to push in github is to commit a few changes and refactoring code and see the difference in numbers of code lines and efficiently when, on my perspective, the algorithm is well.

PD: The code it was written in spanish, because the teachers dont belive if the code is in english xD, but i will make a translation soon

Algorithms:
AVL TREE:
  Objective: Make an algorithm of AVL Tree with the functions: Insertion, Delete, Search, Preorder, PostOrder,InOrder.
  The tree need to be balanced (the difference between height of nodes must be at most 1)
